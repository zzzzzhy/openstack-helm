Mission

simply, resiliently, and flexibly deploy OpenStack and related services
on Kubernetes.

Storyboard
----------

You found an issue and want to make sure we are aware of it? You can do so on our
`Storyboard <https://storyboard.openstack.org/#!/project_group/64>`_.

Bugs should be filed as stories in Storyboard, not GitHub.

Please be as much specific as possible while describing an issue. Usually having
more context in the bug description means less efforts for a developer to
reproduce the bug and understand how to fix it.

Also before filing a bug to the Openstack-Helm `Storyboard <https://storyboard.openstack.org/#!/project_group/64>`_
please try to identify if the issue is indeed related to the deployment
process and not to the deployable software.
